🧠 IBM Data Science Project Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio created as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, completed through Infosys Springboard. This repository features a collection of practical, hands-on projects that showcase my journey in mastering data science tools and techniques — from Python programming to building interactive dashboards.

🧪 Project 1:Python-Project-For-Data-Sc
A foundational notebook covering core Python concepts such as data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and simple data analysis — all built within Jupyter Notebook. This project served as my entry point into the world of data science.

📈 Project 2:TOOLS_FOR_DATASCIENCE
In this financial data project, I performed a comparative analysis between Tesla and GameStop using:

📉 yFinance for fetching stock data

🌐 BeautifulSoup for scraping financial news

📊 Matplotlib & Plotly for visualizations

This project enhanced my skills in time-series analysis, data cleaning, and financial storytelling.
